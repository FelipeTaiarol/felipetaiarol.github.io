                    <p>Nivea (pronounced [niˈveːaː][1]) is a German personal care brand that specializes in body-care. It is owned by the Hamburg-based company Beiersdorf Global AG. The company was founded on 28 March 1882, by Paul Carl Beiersdorf. In 1890, it was sold to Oscar Troplowitz. Troplowitz worked with his consultant Paul Gerson Unna and the German chemist Isaac Lifschütz, developed a new skin care cream. In 1900, Lifschütz developed a water-in-oil emulsion with Eucerit, the first stable emulsion . This was the origin of Eucerin. Nivea comes from the Latin word niveus, meaning "snow-white".[2]
                    During the 1930s, Beiersdorf started producing different kind of products such as tanning oils, shaving creams, shampoo and facial cleanser and toners. The trademark "Nivea" was expropriated in many countries because of World War II. The confiscated trademark rights was completely bought back by Beiersdorf. During the 1980s, the Nivea brand expanded into a wider global market.
